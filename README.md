# 🚀 Fastify Bank Service API because Money Needs Speed!

## Overview
This is a blazingly fast banking service built with Fastify (thanks Matteo Collina! 🙌), implementing best practices and core Fastify features that'll make your transactions fly faster than your money does.

## Features

### Core Fastify Features (The Secret Sauce 🌟)
- **High Performance**: So fast, your money arrives before you send it
- **Schema Validation**: Because nobody likes unexpected surprises in banking
- **TypeScript Support**: Making sure your types are as strict as your accountant
- **Plugins Architecture**: Like LEGO® for grown-up developers
- **Hooks System**: Catching requests like a boss
- **Decorators**: Making your code fancy (and functional)
- **Serialization**: JSON at the speed of light
- **Logging**: Keeping receipts better than your grandmother

### Security Features (Fort Knox Style 🏰)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based, because we trust you, but let's verify anyway
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (because not everyone can be a bank CEO)
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against DDoS attacks (sorry, eager robots!)
- **Helmet Integration**: Keeping your headers as safe as a motorcycle rider
- **CORS**: Playing nice with others (but not too nice)
- **Input Validation**: Trust no input, validate everything
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: No Bobby Tables allowed here
- **API Key Management**: Keys to the kingdom, handled with care

### Banking-Specific Features (The Money Stuff 💰)

- **Payment Processing**: Moving digital money at Fastify speed
- **Balance Inquiries**: Find out how much you haven't spent yet
- **Transfer Services**: Like teleportation, but for money
- **Audit Logging**: Because every penny has a story to tell
